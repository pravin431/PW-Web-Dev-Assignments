    Single-line comments:
Use <!-- to start a comment, and to end it. Everything between these markers is considered a comment. -->

<!-- Multi-line comments:
In HTML, you cannot use a syntax for multi-line comments like some other programming languages. 
However, you can achieve a similar effect by using multiple single-line comments. -->
