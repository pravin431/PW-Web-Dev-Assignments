HTML Tags:
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) uses tags to define elements on a web page. Tags are structural or semantic markers that tell the browser how to interpret and display the content. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< and >). Most tags come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag.

For example:

html
Copy code
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
In this example:

<p> is the opening tag.
</p> is the closing tag.
The content "This is a paragraph." is the text within the paragraph element.
HTML Elements:
An HTML element consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. The combination of the opening tag, content, and closing tag forms a complete HTML element. Elements can be as simple as a paragraph or as complex as an entire page.

For example:

html
Copy code
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
In this example:

<a> is the opening tag.
</a> is the closing tag.
href="https://www.example.com" is an attribute of the a element.
The content "Visit Example" is the text within the anchor element.
The entire structure <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a> is the HTML element.
