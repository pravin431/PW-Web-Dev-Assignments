In JavaScript, declaring variables is a fundamental aspect of programming. Variables are used to store and manage data in a program. They allow developers to assign values to identifiers and manipulate those values as needed. The let keyword is one of the ways to declare variables in JavaScript.

Purpose of Declaring Variables:
Storage of Data:

Variables provide a way to store and manage data within a program. They act as containers for values.
Manipulation of Values:

Variables allow developers to manipulate values by performing operations, calculations, and transformations.
Dynamic Content:

In web development, variables are often used to dynamically update and change the content of a webpage in response to user interactions or external events.
Scope Management:

Variables have different scopes (local and global), which control where they can be accessed and modified within a program.
Declaring Variables using let:
The let keyword is used to declare variables in JavaScript. It allows you to create variables with block scope, which means the variable is only accessible within the block of code where it is declared.

Syntax:

javascript
Copy code
let variableName;
Example:

javascript
Copy code
let age;  // Declaration without initialization
age = 25; // Initialization with a value

let firstName = "John"; // Declaration and initialization in one line
In the example above:

let age; declares a variable named age without assigning a value initially.
age = 25; assigns the value 25 to the variable age.
let firstName = "John"; declares a variable named firstName and initializes it with the string value "John" in a single line.
Reassigning Values:
javascript
Copy code
let x = 10;
console.log(x); // Output: 10

x = 20; // Reassigning the value
console.log(x); // Output: 20
Scope Example:
javascript
Copy code
function exampleFunction() {
  let localVar = "I am a local variable";
  console.log(localVar);
}

exampleFunction(); // Output: "I am a local variable"

// Accessing localVar outside the function would result in an error
// console.log(localVar); // Error: localVar is not defined
