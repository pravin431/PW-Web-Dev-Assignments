HTML (HyperText Markup Language):

HTML is a markup language used to structure content on the web. It defines the structure and presentation of web content, such as text, images, links, and other elements.
HTML provides the basic building blocks for creating web pages.
JavaScript:

JavaScript is a programming language used for creating dynamic and interactive content on the web. It allows for the manipulation of HTML and CSS, handling user interactions, and performing asynchronous operations.
2. Role:
HTML:

HTML is responsible for defining the structure and layout of a web page. It includes elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, images, forms, and links.
Example:
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="An example image">
</body>
</html>
JavaScript:

JavaScript is responsible for adding interactivity to a web page. It can respond to user actions, manipulate the DOM, and communicate with servers to fetch and update data.
Example:
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Interactive Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 id="greeting">Hello, World!</h1>
  <button onclick="changeGreeting()">Change Greeting</button>

  <script>
    function changeGreeting() {
      document.getElementById("greeting").innerHTML = "New Greeting!";
    }
  </script>
</body>
</html>
3. Syntax:
HTML:

HTML uses a tag-based syntax to define elements and their attributes. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets.
Example:
html
Copy code
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
JavaScript:

JavaScript uses a more traditional programming language syntax with statements, variables, and functions.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
function greet(name) {
  alert('Hello, ' + name + '!');
}

greet('John');
4. Execution:
HTML:

HTML is parsed and rendered by the browser to display the static content of a web page. It does not involve programmatic logic or dynamic behavior.
JavaScript:

JavaScript code is executed by the browser's JavaScript engine. It adds interactivity to the web page by responding to events, modifying the DOM, and making asynchronous requests.
5. Inclusion in Documents:
HTML:

HTML is directly written within HTML documents and is responsible for structuring the content of the page.
JavaScript:

JavaScript code can be embedded directly in HTML using <script> tags or included from external files. It enhances the functionality of the page.
6. Examples of Use Cases:
HTML:

Defining the structure and content of a webpage.
Creating forms for user input.
Displaying images, videos, and other media.
JavaScript:

Validating and processing user input in forms.
Implementing interactive features like sliders, dropdowns, and accordions.
Making asynchronous requests to update content without refreshing the page.
Performing calculations and data manipulations on the client side.
