Importance of Comments:
Documentation:

Comments provide a means to document the purpose, functionality, or usage of different parts of the code. This documentation is invaluable for developers who work on the codebase in the future.
Readability:

Well-placed comments enhance code readability by explaining complex logic, algorithms, or intentions behind specific code segments. This is particularly useful for team collaboration.
Debugging:

Comments can be used to temporarily disable or comment out code during debugging. This helps isolate issues and identify problematic sections without actually removing the code.
Code Navigation:

Comments act as signposts within the code, guiding developers to relevant sections or indicating the beginning and end of logical blocks. This aids in code navigation and understanding.
Maintainability:

Over time, codebases evolve and undergo changes. Comments help maintain the code by providing context and explanations for future developers who may need to modify or extend the code.
Examples of Comments:
Single-Line Comment:
javascript
Copy code
// This is a single-line comment
let x = 5;  // Initializing a variable
In the example above, the // denotes a single-line comment. Anything after // on the same line is considered a comment and is ignored by the JavaScript engine. This type of comment is suitable for short explanations or comments on a specific line.

Multi-Line Comment:
javascript
Copy code
/*
  This is a multi-line comment.
  It can span multiple lines and is useful for
  providing more extensive explanations or comments.
*/
let y = 10;  // Another variable initialization
The /* */ syntax is used for multi-line comments. Everything between /* and */ is treated as a comment. Multi-line comments are helpful when providing detailed explanations or commenting out multiple lines of code.

Example Use Case:
javascript
Copy code
/*
  Function to calculate the area of a rectangle.
  Parameters:
    - length: Length of the rectangle
    - width: Width of the rectangle
  Returns:
    - Area of the rectangle
*/
function calculateRectangleArea(length, width) {
  // Using the formula for rectangle area: area = length * width
  return length * width;
}
