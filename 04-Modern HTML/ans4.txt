3 Ways to Improve Accessibility of HTML:
Semantic HTML:

Use the most appropriate HTML elements for their intended content.
This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the structure of your page and navigate it effectively.
Examples:
Use <h1> to <h6> elements for headings.
Use <p> elements for paragraphs.
Use <ul> or <ol> elements for lists.
Use <a> elements for links.
Provide Alternative Text for Images:

Use the alt attribute on <img> tags to describe the content of the image for users who cannot see it.
This is especially important for visually impaired users who rely on screen readers.
The alt text should be concise and informative, but not too long.
Use Headings Correctly:

Headings help users understand the structure and organization of your content.
Use a logical hierarchy of headings, starting with <h1> for the main title and progressing through <h2>, <h3>, etc. for subheadings.
This makes your content easier to scan and navigate, especially for users with cognitive disabilities.
