HTML Entities
HTML entities are a way to represent special characters in HTML. They are used to display characters that would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code, and invisible characters like non-breaking spaces.

Here are 5 commonly used HTML entities:

&amp;: This entity represents the ampersand symbol (&). It is used because the ampersand is also used to introduce HTML entities, so it needs to be escaped if you want to display it literally.
&lt;: This entity represents the less-than sign (<). It is used to escape the less-than sign so that it doesn't get interpreted as the start of an HTML tag.
&gt;: This entity represents the greater-than sign (>). It is used to escape the greater-than sign so that it doesn't get interpreted as the end of an HTML tag.
&nbsp;: This entity represents a non-breaking space. It is used to insert a space that won't be broken at the end of a line.
&quot;: This entity represents a double quote ("). It is used to escape double quotes so that they can be used inside attribute values.
Here are some additional commonly used HTML entities:

&copy;: Copyright symbol (©)
&reg;: Registered trademark symbol (®)
&euro;: Euro symbol (€)
&trade;: Trademark symbol (™)
&apos;: Single quote (')
&cent;: Cent sign (¢)
&emsp;: Em space (four spaces)
