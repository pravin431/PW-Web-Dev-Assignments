Version control is a system that manages and tracks changes to a project's code or files over time. It enables collaborative development by allowing multiple contributors to work simultaneously, keeping a chronological history of changes, supporting branching for isolated development, and facilitating code review. Version control ensures code stability, helps in identifying and rectifying errors, and provides a backup mechanism for disaster recovery. It is a crucial tool in software development for maintaining organization, collaboration, and code quality.
