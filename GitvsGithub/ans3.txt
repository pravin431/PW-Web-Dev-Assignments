.gitignore is a configuration file used in Git to specify files and directories that should be ignored and not tracked by version control. It is essential for maintaining a clean and focused version control system. Here's why it's important:

Exclude Unnecessary Files:

Many projects generate files or directories during development that are not meant to be part of the version-controlled codebase (e.g., compiled binaries, log files, temporary files). The .gitignore file allows you to specify patterns for these files so that Git automatically ignores them.
Avoid Versioning Sensitive Information:

It helps prevent the accidental inclusion of sensitive information, such as configuration files containing API keys or passwords, in the version control system. By specifying such files in .gitignore, you ensure they are not added to the repository..gitignore is a configuration file used in Git to specify files and directories that should be ignored and not tracked by version control.
