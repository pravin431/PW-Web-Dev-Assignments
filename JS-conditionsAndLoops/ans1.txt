Conditional statements in JavaScript allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions. They help you execute different blocks of code depending on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false. The most commonly used conditional statements are if, else if, and else.

1. if statement:
The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.

Syntax:

javascript

if (condition) {
  // Code to be executed if the condition is true
}
Example:

javascript

let age = 20;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
}
2. if-else statement:
The if-else statement allows you to execute one block of code if the condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.

Syntax:

javascript

if (condition) {
  // Code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // Code to be executed if the condition is false
}
Example:

javascript

let temperature = 25;

if (temperature > 30) {
  console.log("It's hot outside.");
} else {
  console.log("It's not too hot.");
}
3. if-else if statement:
The if-else if statement allows you to check multiple conditions and execute different blocks of code based on the first true condition.

Syntax:

javascript

if (condition1) {
  // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // Code to be executed if condition2 is true
} else {
  // Code to be executed if none of the conditions are true
}
Example:

javascript

let time = 14;

if (time < 12) {
  console.log("Good morning!");
} else if (time < 18) {
  console.log("Good afternoon!");
} else {
  console.log("Good evening!");
}
